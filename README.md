# NumberGuesser_game

In this game, we have a NumberGuesser class that encapsulates the game logic. It takes in the minimum and maximum range of numbers, as well as the number of attempts allowed. The constructor initializes the random number generator and generates a secret number within the specified range.

The playGame() method runs the game loop, where the player enters their guesses. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, adjusting the range accordingly. If the player guesses the correct number, they win the game. If they run out of attempts, the game ends, and the secret number is revealed.

In the main() function, we create a NumberGuesser object and start the game by calling the playGame() method.

You can compile and run this code to play the Number Guesser game. Have fun guessing the number!
